                        Hello, my name is Joe Huelsman and I am twenty eight years old. I am from Gardner, Kansas where
                        I grew up
                        with a small family just my parents, my younger brother, and myself. As a child I was very
                        active in sports,
                        I played baseball, basketball, football and for a very brief moment soccer but quickly learned I
                        did not
                        like running. In high school I had a passion for all things computers and ended up taking some
                        coding
                        classes my sophomore thru senior year of high school. I have always had a interest in how the
                        internet and
                        websites work and have recently decided to go back and I am now currently enrolled in the KU
                        Coding Boot
                        Camp program. I will be sharing some of the work that I will be doing over the course of the
                        next six
                        months. I hope that you will be able to see my skills grow and develop and I aim to become a
                        proficient and
                        hardworking developer.
